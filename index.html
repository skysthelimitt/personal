      <p class="left">i'm sky! i'm just a simple person, learning all different types of computer science, but focusing on web development. i was always interested by computers, and always had a love for them. i started off with a project called <a href="https://github.com/Games-From-Flash/swf/">The Flash Games Archive</a>, which was a simple website for me and my friends to play old flash games during school, it helped teach me a lot about the fundamentals of html and css, i then moved onto a new project, which has gone through multiple names, but is currently called <a href="https://github.com/skysthelimitt/selenite">Selenite</a>. this project has really taught me about more complicated css, and even javascript, and is helping me build my knowledge on how to use javascript and jquery.</p>
